    <h2>Hello, I'm Maulana</h2>
    <p>
      a college student who is exploring the world of programming with passion.
      Currently, I'm studying in the IT field and aspire to establish an
      inclusive programming community in Indonesia, a place where everyone can
      learn and grow together without limitations. If you are interested in
      collaborating or exchanging ideas about programming, you can contact me
      via the email page maulanazahiri31@gmail.com. Then to conclude, let us
      together create a supportive environment for growth and innovation in the
      world of programming!.
